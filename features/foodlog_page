Feature: Food Input Page

Scenario: User logs a food item
  Given I am logged in
  When I go to the food input page
  And I enter "Eggs" and "150 calories"
  And I click "Add"
  Then I should see "Eggs - 150 calories" in my food log
  And my remaining calories for the day should be updated

Scenario: User selects a food from suggested list
  Given I am on the food input page
  When I select "Grilled Chicken" from suggested foods
  Then the calorie field should auto-fill with "200"
  And I can add it to my daily log
